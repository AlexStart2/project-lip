# Project LIP: A Small Rust Compiler
Welcome to Project LIP, a small Rust compiler implemented in OCaml. This project aims to provide a minimalistic yet functional Rust compiler for educational and experimental purposes.

# Introduction
Project LIP is designed to be a lightweight and simple Rust compiler. It supports a subset of the Rust language and is built to demonstrate the core principles of compiler design and implementation.

# Features
Basic Rust syntax parsing
Semantic analysis
Intermediate representation (IR) generation
Code generation to a target executable
Error reporting and debugging
